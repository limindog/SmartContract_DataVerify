# SmartContract_DataVerify  
Simple but mighty application of SmartContract.  
I use weather data for example to apply data verify.  
Only owner can change SafeList and ownerAddress.  
Only address on SafeList can add, update and delete data.  
All public user can get weather data.(Other permission is also available)  

This sample show up SmartContract's advantage.  
We can easily get accurate data from specific user(In this example, specific user is weather bureau).
